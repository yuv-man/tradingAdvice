# Machine Learning Models Enhancement Rules

## Model Architecture
- Implement proper cross-validation with time series data
- Create feature importance visualization for model transparency
- Add ensemble methods with proper weighting schemes
- Implement online learning for model updates
- Create model confidence metrics

## Feature Engineering
- Implement automated feature selection with statistical testing
- Add temporal features (day of week, month effects)
- Create interaction features between indicators
- Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Add feature scaling with robust scalers

## Model Evaluation
- Implement proper backtesting framework with walk-forward testing
- Add metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC)
- Create confusion matrix visualization
- Implement statistical significance testing for model performance
- Add profit/loss metrics for trading simulation

## Advanced Models
- Add gradient boosting models (LightGBM, CatBoost)
- Implement simple recurrent neural networks for time series
- Create hybrid models that combine ML with rule-based approaches
- Add Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification
- Implement reinforcement learning for adaptive strategies

## Model Management
- Create model versioning system
- Implement model A/B testing framework
- Add feature drift detection
- Create model performance monitoring
- Implement model explanation tools
