# Data Retrieval Enhancement Rules

## API Handling
- Implement proper rate limiting for all external API calls
- Add exponential backoff for failed requests
- Validate all incoming data before processing
- Create adapter classes for each data source to standardize interfaces
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for unreliable APIs

## Data Sources
- Diversify data sources to reduce dependency on any single provider
- Add Alpha Vantage API as alternative to yfinance
- Implement Yahoo Finance scraping with rotating proxies to prevent blocking
- Add support for IEX Cloud API for more reliable financial data
- Include data from financial RSS feeds as additional sources

## Caching
- Implement disk-based caching with TTL (time-to-live) expiration
- Use Redis or SQLite for caching frequently accessed data
- Add cache invalidation strategies for rapidly changing data
- Implement a CacheManager class with clear API
- Add cache statistics/metrics for optimization

## Data Quality
- Verify data completeness and correctness with cross-validation
- Detect and handle outliers in financial data
- Implement data cleaning pipelines for each data source
- Add data integrity checks before and after transformations
- Create visualization tools for data quality monitoring

## Enhancement Patterns
- For each data source (Yahoo Finance, Finviz, etc.):
  - Add robust error detection
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff
  - Create dedicated adapter classes
  - Add comprehensive logging
  - Include data validation
